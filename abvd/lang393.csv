393,Kuni,"Alan Jones, Barnabas Maua, Malcolm Ross",kse,kuni1263,"All stems functioning as finite verbs are preceded by a subject-marking clitic or prefix. In the third person (the usual citation form) this can be either e- or i-. The former marks the verb as irrealis while the latter is the characteristic form for narratives. I have chosen to represent all verbs with the irrealis e- form, for consistency.All noun stems that may be inalienably possessed (body parts, relations, etc.) are represented with the 3rd person suffix marker -na, indexing a third person \"\"possessor\"\" - such stems, when used as adjectives, as a general rule take a person-marking suffix ; on some stems this has become fossilised, while others resist it (possibly only in some uses). Hyphenation indicates affixation;  even the subject markers are represented here as prefixes, though the argument for this has yet to be made.",,"Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Western Oceanic, Papuan Tip, Peripheral, Central Papuan, West Central Papuan, Nuclear","Janet Moody",,"@misc{Ross-393-2006,  author = \"Malcolm Ross\",  date = \"2006\",  howpublished = \"personal communication\"}"
