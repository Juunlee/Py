476,Orkon,"Crowley, Lynch, Early - notes",,orko1234,"A moribund language of West Ambrym, Vanuatu, now spoken by almost no active speakers, maybe 40 or so have a passive knowledge of it.","In some cases in our notes, there is some dispute as to whether a vowel is e or open e, or again o or open o. No final phonemic analysis of the vowels has been done, due to inadequate data. We believe that possibly the sole fluent speaker (who we worked with briefly) has since died.","Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, North and Central Vanuatu, Northeast Vanuatu-Banks Islands, East Vanuatu","John Lynch",,"@misc{Crowley-476-2007,  author = \"Terry Crowley, John Lynch, Robert Early\",  date = \"2007\",  howpublished = \"personal communication\"}"
