1198,Ainu,"John D. Bengtson",aib,ainu1251,"The data in this list are derived from three sources, two written by John D. Bengtson from the \"Association for the Study of Language in Prehistory,\" and one by Rev. John Batchelor.Titled \"A Multilateral Look at Greater Austric\" (2006) and \"The 'Greater Austric' Hypothesis\" from \"Linguistic Fossils: Studies in Historical Linguistics and Paleolinguistics\" (2010). Bengtson's articles seek to find cognates from a variety of languages from different Asiatic language families, including Ainu, Austroasiatic (= Munda - Mon-Khmer), Austronesian, Daic (= Tai-Kadai), Hmong-Mien (Miao-Yao), Nihali.  These families are shown to form one, huge hypothetical macro-family called \"Austric.\" Batchelor's work is called the \"An Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary\" (1905).The Ainu language (spoken by the indigenous Ainu people of Hokkaido, Japan,Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, and the Kamchatka peninsula) is shown to have several likely cognates that would place it within Greater Austric, if not Austronesian.Sources:* Batchelor, John. 1905.
