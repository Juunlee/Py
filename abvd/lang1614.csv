OZANNE-RIVIERRE & A-G.HAUDRICOURT",nem,nemi1240,"The lexical data used here come from the book writen by two linguists : Françoise OZANNE-RIVIERRE and André-Georges HAUDRICOURT, Dictionnaire thématique des langues de la région de Hienghène (Nouvelle-Calédonie) : PIJE – FWÂI – NEMI – JAWE (published in 1982). This book presents a thematic lexicon and a phonological comparaison of four languages, based on several fieldworks made by André-Georges HAUDRICOURT (in 1959) and Françoise OZANNE-RIVIERRE (1973, 1976, 1978). The lexicon is translating french words into those four targeted languages. They are spoken on the north-west side of the Grande Terre island in New Caledonia. - If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything else- If more than one word in Nemi, Jawe, has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' column- As the authors provide sometimes the lexical item form within and out of a possessive construction (note that there is two types of possession in this language : alienable and unalienable), we have decided to retain the corresponding forms provided for unalienable possession, althought the possessive personal pronoun itself has not been retained. Only the word with a dash (for instance 'cii-', 'his/her skin') has been entered along with the world out of possessive contructions, when showed by the authorsSome worlds have different forms depending on the geographical location. Those locations to which are related those different forms are put in parenthesis ('T' is for Tendo and 'C' is for Coulna)",,"Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, New Caledonian, Northern, North, Nemi","David PIEKUT",,
