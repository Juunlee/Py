London: Routledge.The Red Gelao informants are semi-speakers with limited knowledge of lexical items. The informant on the Vietnamese side was from Na Khê, Yên Minh District, Hà Giang, Vietnam; data was collected on May 25, 1997 by Jerold Edmondson. The nearby village of Bìch Đich also has Red Gelao speakers. The informant on the Chinese side, Yang Yucai, 62, was from Fanpo (翻坡), Malipo County, Yunnan, China; data was collected during the summer of 2003 by Li Jinfang. Reportedly, there were also Red Gelao speakers in Tianba (田坝) and Xinzhai (新寨) in Malipo County, Yunnan, China. Possibly no more than a few dozen speakers remain on both sides.",,"Tai-Kadai, Kra, Western Kra","Andrew C.
