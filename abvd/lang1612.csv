1612,"Tîrî (Tsîrî - Tintin)","George W. Grace",cir,tiri1261,"The data provided here come from a dictionnary Tîrî-English made by George W. Grace. During the summers of 1972 and 1973, he collected lexical data in the La Foa area, located between the center and the south region of the Main Land ('Grante Terre') of New Caledonia. The dictionary have been published in the Pacific Linguistics journal (Series C - n°12) of 1976.This work contains a short phonetical and phonological introduction and a Tîrî-English lexicon.Methodology used here : If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything elseIf more than one word in Tîrî has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' columnThe word with the most general meaning have been retained.If a word that is morphologically dependant and generally attached to an other word, it has been transcribed with a dash before or after word.If the semantic distinction between several words is not clear, those words have been provided with a comment in the 'Author annotation' column regarding to this lack of semantic distinction.","The data provided by the dictionnary of George W. Grace has been trancribed phonetically, althought the authors gives his comments on this language alphabetization. The phonetical alphabet the author uses is, for some sounds, different from the actual International Phonetical Alphabet (IPA). This problem has been solved here, except for the sound that he is transcribing [ř]. As I have not found, for this sound, a transcription that fits the IPA, it has been transcribed like the original one George W. Grace uses ([ř]).","Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, New Caledonian, Southern, South, Zire-Tiri","David PIEKUT",,
