1573,Fwâi,"F. OZANNE-RIVIERRE and A-G HAUDRICOURT",fwa,fwai1237,"The lexical data used here come from the book writen by Françoise OZANNE-RIVIERRE and André-Georges HAUDRICOURT, Dictionnaire thématique des langues de la région de Hienghène (Nouvelle-Calédonie) : PIJE – FWÂI – NEMI – JAWE (published in 1982). This book presents a thematic lexicon and a phonological comparaison of those four languages, based on several fieldworks made by two linguists : André-Georges HAUDRICOURT (in 1959) and Françoise OZANNE-RIVIERRE (1973, 1976, 1978). The lexicon is translating french words into those four targeted languages. They are spoken on the north-west side of the Grande Terre island in New Caledonia.","Data entry methodology remarks : - The words with the more general meaning have been entered.- When possible, only the lexical radicals have been entered here (those radicals are presented by the authors).- When the lexical item entered is a affixe, it starts or end with a dash- When several lexical items are possible for a word in the list, the phonological words have been retained before anything else. Note that there are no comments from the authors on how frequent each word is, when they are all refering to the same notion.Note as well that there are no comments on borrowings.- When several lexical items, with no general meaning, correspond to a word in the list, those meaning have been noted in the comments- The phonetic alphabet used by the authors is partially different from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) used here ; since the consonnant and vowel systems for Fwâi are presented by the authors, we have been able to transcribe according to the IPA the following sounds : [s] : [ç][y] : [ʝ]Data entry general remarks :.- When the lexical item entered is a affixe, it starts or end with a dash.- If a lexical item is resulting of a lexicalized composition or derivation, the construction resulting in a word is noted by a dash (for instance  pun-ⁿga, ‘hair-of the head’).","Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, New Caledonian, Northern, North, Nemi","David PIEKUT",,
