RIVERRE himself and Sabine EHRHART between 1995 and 1999 in the villages of Népou and Oundjo.Methodology:The book of RIVIERRE & al. Contains two dictionnairies.The first one translates the bwatoo lexical items in french and provides more semantic features.The second one translates the french lexical items in bwatoo, and provides only a translation without providing any additionnal information on the semantic features. The second dictionnary has been used first. When there is more than one term found in bwatoo for one lexical entry in french, the first dictionnary and the developped semantic features it provides has been used to reduce as much as possible the variation and to keep the more relevant term.Borrowings and selected data:The lexical items selected here are coming from Jean-Claude RIVIERRE and al.The items borrowed to other languages have not been included. For the most part, borrowings have been listed by the authors. However, the words coming from the french language have not been subject to such a list. They have been excluded by David PIEKUT when possible.","Several lexical items refer to the same notion. When we have not been able to reduce a case of synonymy, all of the words found have been entered with specifications in the column \"Author Annotation\"","Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, New Caledonian, Northern, North, Hmwaveke","David PIEKUT (EPHE/LACITO-CNRS)",,
