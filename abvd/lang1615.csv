1615,"Numèè (Nââ Numèè)","RIVIERRE Jean-Claude, ??-2018",kdk,nume1242,"The lexical data entered here are coming from a yet to be ended and published Dictionnaire Numèè-Français made by Jean-Claude RIVIERRE (†). This linguist has work, before this lexicon, on a phonoligical comparaison of the New Caledonia south languages, including the Numèè language, still spoken nowadays in this area (RIVIERRE, J-C, 'Phonologie comparée des dialectes d'extrème sud de la Nouvelle-Calédonie', Paris : Selaf, pp. 216).This lexicon provides recent lexical data, from the Numèè language to French, and, through the transcription alphabet used, phonetic data. However, there is no phonetical or phonological introduction. To complete the transcription, this list has used the more recent description work on the Numèè language. This work is the Fabrice Wallice thesis, \"Description morpho-syntaxique du nââ numèè (langue de Yaté, Extrême-Sud de la Nouvelle-Calédonie) \" (co-dir. C. Moyse-Faurie & J. Vernaudon, univ. de la Nouvelle-Calédonie), INALCO, defended on the 8th of november 2013. This work presents a usefully and reliable synthesis of all the writings that has been propoed for the Numèè language.Note on the methodology : - The borrowed lexical item have been signaled in the source lexicon and have not been retained here- The word that are morphologically dependant, working as attached words, has been transcribed with a dash before or after the word- When several words in the source lexicon have been found for a single english word in the list, the one with a meaning closer to the english word have been retained.- When it has been impossible to find the semantic distinction between several words, they all have been entered, althought the lack of found distinction has been noted in the 'Author annotation' collumn.- When a morphologically dependant word has been found along with a fully independant word, the fully independant word has been retained.",,"Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, New Caledonian, Southern, Extreme Southern","David PIEKUT",,
