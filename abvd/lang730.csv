The language is endangered and is rapidly losing child speakers. This dissertation introduces the language situation and discusses phonology (synchronic and historical) and morphosyntax (word order, word classes, the verb complex, aspect, case marking, nominalization, question formation, relative clauses and other essential aspects of Dupaningan grammar). Dupaningan Agta has a relatively simple phonological system, with fifteen consonants and five vowels. Of note, *a has been fronted to /i/ or /e/ after the voiced stops /b d g/. Morphosyntactically, the language has a typical Philippine-type \"focus\" or \"symmetrical voice\" system. The topics of transitivity and ergativity are explored in this dissertation, with special reference to an interesting \"double-object\" construction with two syntactic subjects.
