1609,Xârâgurè,"Claire Moyse-Faurie",axx,xara1243,"The Xârâgurè language is spoken on the east cost of the Great Land ('Grande Terre') of New Calédonia, around the Thio district.The data presented here are coming from the 2014 version of a yet to be published dictionnary Xârâguè-French. Those data have been collected by Claire Moyse-Faurie during two fieldworks in 1977 and 1980. This linguist provided a description of the Xârâcùù language, spoken near the Xârâgurè area.The source lexicon used here provides an under construction lexicon, as well as a sketch of the Xârâgurè grammar and phonology system.I personnaly thank Claire Moyse-Faurie for making available to me those precious data.Methodology : If for an english word in the list, there are several lexical item including one single lexical unit, a compound (i.e made of several lexical units), or even a word resulting of a derivation, the word being a single lexical unit has been retained before anything elseIf more than one word in Xârâgurè has been found for a single english word, some specifications about the use of the different words not being morphological variables have been, when possible, provided in the 'Author annotation' columnThe word with the most general meaning have been retained.If a word that is morphologically dependant and generally attached to an other word, it has been transcribed with a dash before or after word.If the semantic distinction between several words is not clear, those words have been provided with a comment in the 'Author annotation' column regarding to this lack of semantic distinction.",,"Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, New Caledonian, Southern, South, Xaracuu-Xaragure","David PIEKUT",,
